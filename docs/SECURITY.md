# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the last 6 months |
| 7.0-8.9   | Releases within the last 3 months |
| 4.0-6.9   | Most recent release               |
| 0.0-3.9   | No support                        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through our [security advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/next-nebula-starter/security/advisories/new) page.

You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity.

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

   - Strict CSP headers are set in Next.js configuration
   - Inline scripts are prohibited unless explicitly allowed
   - External resources are limited to trusted domains

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - Secure session management with Supabase
   - Role-based access control
   - Password policies enforcement

3. **Data Protection**

   - HTTPS enforced in production
   - Sensitive data encryption at rest
   - Regular security audits

4. **Dependencies**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Lock file maintenance

## Best Practices

When contributing to this repository, please ensure you follow these security best practices:

1. Never commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials, etc.)
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Follow the principle of least privilege
4. Validate all inputs
5. Sanitize all outputs
6. Use parameterized queries
7. Implement rate limiting for APIs
8. Log security-relevant events

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions and notify users
