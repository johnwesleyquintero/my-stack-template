# Contributing to Next Nebula Starter

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Next Nebula Starter as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the docs with any new features or changes
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Code Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality. Please ensure your code:

- Follows the existing style
- Is well-documented with comments
- Uses TypeScript types appropriately
- Follows React best practices
